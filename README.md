# SGURLProtocol

Custom CFHTTPMessage based NSURLProtocol subclass, useful if you want to add authentication dialogs to a UIWebView


Use with care, althouht I have spend a considerable hight amount of hours debugging this code, there are probably edge-cases which aren't covered correctly.
In my experience media rich websites sometimes fail.

### Demo
For example code see [SGWebViewController](https://github.com/graetzer/Foxbrowser/blob/master/Foxbrowser/Content/WebView/SGWebViewController.m) from my Foxbrowser app
